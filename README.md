# Project Management

This project presents itself as 2 API's implemented in Go and Express.

These API's are meant to be the backend of a project management tool similar to a Kanban Board where for existing projects there exist clients and developers assigned to the project. The project can have multiple tasks and subtasks with different priority levels and assigned to different developers.

Each API is containerized in a Docker image and is orchestrated with Kubernetes.
